Extension: Developer Productivity Tools
Overview:
The Developer Productivity Tools extension is designed to streamline various common tasks that developers face during web development, testing, and debugging. It integrates multiple utilities like JSON formatting, managing browser storage (LocalStorage and SessionStorage), handling network requests, clipboard management, User-Agent switching, and code snippet storage. The extension provides a clean and intuitive interface with easy-to-access tabs for each feature, making it an all-in-one tool for enhancing developer productivity.

Key Features:
JSON Formatter:

This tab allows developers to quickly format JSON data for better readability. Users can paste raw JSON strings into the input box, and the extension will format it with proper indentation and spacing.
Useful when working with API responses, debugging JSON structures, or cleaning up raw JSON data.
The formatted JSON is displayed instantly in the output area after clicking the "Format JSON" button.
LocalStorage Viewer:

This tab provides a view into the browser's LocalStorage. Developers can easily inspect the key-value pairs stored for the active tab.
LocalStorage is often used by web applications to store persistent user data (like preferences or session tokens), and this tool makes it simple to view or debug the stored information.
With one click, the extension will retrieve and display all LocalStorage data in a human-readable format.
Snippet Manager:

The Snippet Manager allows developers to save, view, and manage reusable code snippets.
This tool is highly useful for storing snippets of code that are frequently reused, such as utility functions, common patterns, or templates.
Snippets are stored in Chromeâ€™s chrome.storage.sync, ensuring persistence even if the extension is closed or the browser is restarted.
Network Requests:

The Network Requests tab enables developers to capture and inspect outgoing network requests made by the active web page.
This is particularly useful for debugging API calls, checking headers, or reviewing responses from third-party services.
The extension provides buttons to start and stop capturing requests, making it easy to control and filter the network activity.
Clipboard Manager:

Clipboard Manager helps developers interact with the system clipboard directly within the browser.
Users can copy content into the clipboard or retrieve and display the current clipboard content.
This feature is useful for quickly copying or pasting long strings, API keys, or formatted text without switching between the browser and external clipboard tools.
User-Agent Switcher:

The User-Agent Switcher allows developers to simulate different browser environments by changing the User-Agent string sent with HTTP requests.
This is particularly useful for testing how a website responds to different devices, browsers, or operating systems without needing to physically switch devices.
Developers can input a custom User-Agent string and apply it, enabling them to see how web pages are rendered or processed under various simulated conditions.
Additional Features:
Dark Mode:

The extension provides a Dark Mode toggle that switches the interface to a darker color scheme. This feature is aimed at developers who prefer working in low-light environments or simply enjoy the aesthetics of dark interfaces.
The Dark Mode setting persists across sessions, offering a consistent user experience.
Tab Interface:

The extension organizes all its features under separate tabs, ensuring a clean and minimal UI. Users can switch between different utilities by clicking on the tabs, each labeled according to its respective function.
The current active tab is highlighted, making navigation intuitive and clear.
Permissions Required:
Storage Permission:
The extension requires access to the browser's storage to save user preferences (like dark mode settings) and manage saved code snippets. LocalStorage and cookies can also be viewed through this permission.

ActiveTab Permission:
This permission allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab, fetching its LocalStorage, cookies, or executing JavaScript in the context of that tab (such as network requests and user-agent changes).

Scripting Permission:
Allows the extension to inject JavaScript code into web pages to execute commands like network monitoring or manipulating storage.

Host Permissions for All URLs (<all_urls>):
The extension needs access to all URLs to inspect network requests and interact with LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and cookies across different web pages.

Use Cases:
Debugging and Testing APIs:
Quickly capture network requests, check headers, and analyze API responses directly in the browser without needing external tools like Postman.

User-Agent Testing:
Change the User-Agent to simulate different browsers, devices, or platforms. This feature is essential for testing how a site behaves across multiple environments (e.g., mobile vs. desktop browsers).

Managing and Inspecting Browser Storage:
Instantly view LocalStorage and SessionStorage values for the current site, which is helpful when developing or debugging client-side storage mechanisms.

Formatting and Validating JSON:
The JSON Formatter feature makes it easy to format unstructured JSON for better readability, which is often useful when working with large datasets or API responses.

Snippet Storage for Reusability:
Save frequently used code snippets for quick reference. This is great for developers who work across different projects but rely on similar coding patterns.

Clipboard Utilities:
Simplify interactions with the clipboard by copying and pasting text directly within the browser. This is especially useful for developers who regularly handle large blocks of text or encoded strings.
